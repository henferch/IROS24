	\section{INTRODUCTION}
	
	According to Moravec's paradox, although machines can perform tasks at adults' level of intelligence such as inductive and deductive reasoning, they have tremendous difficulty with sensory-motor or social skills, as demonstrated by a one-year-old child. Behind this paradox remains the question in artificial intelligence research of what sort of knowledge representation would be suitable for allowing a machine to accomplish cognitive tasks, which has important philosophical implications. Thus, recent studies have contrasted the Cartesian (traditional) view of social cognition as a process confined to the brain, to the notion of an \textit{embodied}, \textit{embedded}, \textit{enacted} and \textit{extended} process, unfolding between the brain, the body and environment in interaction; a perspective known as \textit{4E cognition} \cite{Newen2018}.      
	
	Inspired by embodiment and 4E cognition, we believe that for social robots to leave the lab and adapt to human environments, it is crucial to provide them with forms of behavior regulation which take into account the dynamics of human low-level social skill processes, such as the capacity of engaging in \textit{joint attention} (JA), and the possibility of those processes be modulated in direct interaction. Furthermore, as a multi-dimensional construct, JA involves cognitive skills which constitute forms of social attention at distinct levels of interaction and knowledge sharing \cite{siposova2019}.

		\end{center}
	\end{figure}

	As a continuation of previous research in which we proposed a model for tracking JA in HRI as a topology-based representation organized as a \textit{scale of jointness} \cite{chame2023top}, in this work we investigate the more fundamental aspect of attention selection and how such mechanism could allow the emergence of JA in human-robot interaction from top-down and bottom-up modulation processes. For this, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:multi_robots}, we suppose unconstrained situations where agents can become interested in objects in the environment and eventually share attention and knowledge about them (e.g. situations like asking someone for direction or commenting about salient stimuli like a noise or an object). 
	
	Tacking into account the considerations above, we explore the concept of \textit{ego-sphere} \cite{albus1991} and propose the model named AEGO for tracking the attention focus of agents as represented from egocentric perspective, and resulting from on-board sensory acquisitions. For this, inspired by \textit{dynamic neural fields} (DNF) theory \cite{amari1977}, we model attention selection as dynamical system process represented by neural fields networks with lateral connectivity. By addressing limitations on previous research, we show how neural excitatory and inhibitory interaction allows us to study the emergence of attention selection. Moreover, we show how the model can be used to track agents' interaction with peripersonal space, which is an interesting resource for HRI applications. 
	
	%Tacking into account the considerations above, we propose the model named JA-EGO for tracking the attention focus of agents as represented from egocentric perspective, and resulting from acquisitions of robot's on-board sensory. For this, we model the evolution of attention selection as a dynamical system process represented by a recurrent neural network inspired on \textit{dynamic neural fields} (DNF) theory \cite{amari1977}. Thus, JA-EGO can be used for track egocentric focus of attention from spherical localization references. 
	  	  
	This document is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:previous} discusses previous works and argues how our contribution would help to advance the state of the art in the field. Section \ref{sec:model} presents the mathematical definition of the model and discusses theoretical assumptions behind it. Section \ref{sec:methodology} presents the methodology which consisted in: a) studying in simulation attention selection tracking from top-down and bottom-up modulation processes, and showing potential applications, and b) conducting an experiment with the robot Pepper including proprioception, vision and basic natural language recognition about relations in the environment. Section \ref{sec:results} reports on the studyâ€™s results, and Section \ref{sec:conclusions} presents conclusions and future perspectives.
	  
%	For this, an egocentric perspective for localization is adopted where the robot is able to represent the dynamics of its own focus of attention in an sensory ego-spherical representation as well as tracking others' focus of attention. 
	
	
	\section{PREVIOUS WORK}
	\label{sec:previous}
	
	%Biological studies have pointed out to the existence of biological mechanisms to support essential cognitive functions such as attention, short-term memory, spatio-temporal sensory-motor coordination, and locomotion, among others.

	According to \cite{albus1991} an \textit{ego-sphere} consists of a two dimensional spherical map of the world as perceived by an observer placed at its center. This interesting idea has inspired several works in the field of robotics. A study by \cite{ruesch2008} has shown how attention and short-term memory can be modulated through saliency maps and allow the robot to explore the environment based on novelty. A work by \cite{bodiroza2011} focused on intuitive HRI, including the possibility of top-down modulation of attention. The aspect of information representation has also been studied in \cite{peters2009sensory}, so the ego-sphere has been implemented as a storage data-base indexed by spherical tessellation mapping. Other contributions could be mentioned (e.g. \cite{grotz2017}, \cite{marques2022}).%Other contributions based on these ideas could be mentioned (e.g. \cite{grotz2017}, \cite{marques2022}).
	
	
	To our knowledge, previous research has not explored sufficiently the aspect of interaction dynamics between locations represented in the ego-sphere, considering at most basic forms of interaction spread between nodes. Moreover, excluding saliency map approaches (e.g. \cite{ruesch2008}), the dynamics of attention was modeled as a process governed by knowledge represented in the form of production rules, where the possibility of compositionality from low-level sensory to higher-level decision space has been of less importance. 
	 
	
	%in the field have achieved impressive results by exploring attention saliency in sensory egocentric representations under the effect of modulation processes (e.g. bottom-up \cite{ruesch2008} and top-down \cite{bodiroza2011}). Although most research have considered environment exploration tasks, so the robot can focus on learning new things based on novelty, some have studied social cognition or joint attention tasks inspired on psychological theories of attention (e.g. \cite{ruesch2008}). 
	
	
	
	%Moreover, when resorting to alternative forms of knowledge representation, generality is lost and the possibility of well stablished    
	
	 %as from representation in the same space where attention selection is done. We believe that this is an important limitation, when considering the possibility of investigating compositionality in joint attention as a descending (top-down) generative process combined with an ascending (bottom-up) saliency process, susceptible of study as a dynamical system.   
	
	Another limitation of previous research is considering the robot as the only one in interaction given with embodied sensory ego-spherical representations, so data coming from human agents is mostly represented in the robot's perspective. In our opinion, this would be a too egocentric approach for HRI. We believe that when keeping track of embodied relations between agents and objects in the environment as a distributed dynamical system, the robot could take decisions and behave without relying too much on environment modeling, from the emergence of attention from instantaneous interaction. Hence, we propose that attention selection is tracked simultaneously from participants' egocentric perspective. 
	 
	Our previous research has also constituted relevant steps in the direction of developing the current study which is worth mentioning. In \cite{chame2016} an ego-cylindrical selection mechanism for attention was proposed for autonomous positioning with respect to objects in the environment. In \cite{chame2023top} the model TOP-JAM was proposed as a means for JA tracking in HRI from allocentric references. In \cite{heikkila2019} joint attention in HRI is studied for a providing guidance task in a shopping mall. \textcolor{orange}{[Many papers from the RIS team could be cited: human-aware planning, JA ... To be confirmed with Rachid]}.
	 
	To summarize, we propose to model attention for HRI in neural dynamic fields networks for tracking the influence of three important sources on attention selection: a) bottom-up stimulation, b) top-down modulation, and c) local interactions from inhibitory and excitatory synapse. We named this network AEGO and show how it is a useful representation for tracking attention in HRI, which can be conveniently included in several experimental setups. We present in the section below the mathematical foundations of the model. In Section \ref{sec:methodology} we show how AEGO is suited for investigating joint attention in HRI.

Moreover, the sensory ego-sphere has been proposed as a computational data structure which does not represents directly the focus of attention of participants, neglecting thus the dynamics of interaction, consisting mostly in a data storage repository indexed by tessellation spherical mapping (see \cite{peters2009sensory}).

	\section{THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL}	
	\label{sec:model}
	
	Theoretical models of visual attention such as \textit{feature integration theory} (FIT) \cite{treisman1980}, have described attention as a multi-level information fusion process. According to FIT, at a pre-attention level the perceptual system receives from separate maps encoding feature salience (e.g., color, edges, shapes), which are lately combined at an attention selection stage. A bio-inspired architecture has been proposed from FIT by \cite{koch1985} and implemented by \cite{itti1998}, finding applications in robotics (e.g. autonomous navigation based on vision \cite{siagian2014}).

		\caption{The AEGO model, as detailed in Eqs. \eqref{eq:pre-sel}, \eqref{eq:sel} and \eqref{eq:out}.}
		\label{fig:AEGO}
	\end{figure}

	%Let the agent's peripersonal space be represented by a localization topology defined by a vertex set, resulting from the tessellation of an icosahedron polyhedron, which approximates a spherical region around the agent. 
	Under the influence of previous research, we propose a model of attention selection inspired by FIT and DNF theory. \textcolor{orange}{[We focus not only in vision but on the agent's capacity of recognizing stimuli and roughly calculating their relation to the body in ego-spherical representations]}. Thus, we consider a pre-attention phase where proprioceptive and exteroceptive stimuli excite the ego-space topology, encoded by dynamic fields neural networks, receiving inputs from top-down and bottom-up processes and synaptic interaction. In a posterior stage, attention selection results from competition in synaptic interaction. Hence, we propose the model named AEGO which architectural view is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:AEGO}. The mathematical definition of the model \footnote{\scriptsize \textbf{Notation.} Matrices and vectors are represented in bold, indexes are represented as subscripts (e.g. the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ element of a vector $\mathbf{a}$ is denoted $\mathbf{a}_{i}$). Network layers are vectors. Matrices are represented in capital letter, the colon character represents the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ row or columns vector (e.g. $\mathbf{A}_{i:}$ for columns and $\mathbf{A}_{:i}$ for rows). Position and orientation vectors are in 3D Cartesian space unless stated otherwise. The projection of a 3D position $\mathbf{p}$ in the ego-sphere surface is denoted $\mathbf{\hat{p}}$. The dot product between vectors $\textbf{p}$ and $\textbf{v}$ is denoted $\textbf{p}\cdot\textbf{v}$.} is detailed next.
	
	
	\subsection{Pre-attention phase}
	Let the activation of the $i^\mathrm{th}$ neuron encode the dynamics of stimulation affecting a location  $\mathbf{x}_i$ in 3D Cartesian coordinates at a polyhedron surface representing the agent's ego-space, such that 
		
	\begin{equation}
	\tau_\mathrm{u} \dot{\mathbf{u}}_{i(t)} = -\mathbf{u}_{i(t-1)} + q_\mathrm{u} + \sum_{j}^{} (\mathbf{U}_{ij}+\epsilon)\mathbf{u}_{i(t-1)} + \mathbf{s}_{i(t,\Xi)} 
	\label{eq:pre-sel}
	\end{equation}

	According to the principle of local interconnections \cite{samsonovich97}, the interaction strength $\mathbf{U}_{ij}$ between neurons $i$ and $j$ is selected so proximal locations have stronger interaction. Hence, multivariate Gaussian weights are selected, such that
	
	\begin{equation}
		\mathbf{U}_{ij}(|\mathbf{x}_i-\mathbf{x}_j|) = \frac{\mathrm{exp}\left(-\frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{x}_i-\mathbf{x}_j)^{\mathrm{t}}\mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1}(\mathbf{x}_i-\mathbf{x}_j)\right)}{\sqrt{2\pi^{3}|\mathbf{\Sigma}|}}	
	\label{eq:pre-sel-syn}
	\end{equation}
	
	The term $\mathbf{s}_{i(t,\Xi)}$ represents the stimulation received at time instant $t$ affecting the ego-space locations $\Xi$. As it is going to be detailed in Section \ref{sec:methodology}, this term models stimulation from both top-down and bottom-up processes. Finally, in Eq. \eqref{eq:pre-sel} $q_\mathrm{u}$ corresponds to the activation resting state, $\tau_\mathrm{u}$ is the a time constant, and $\epsilon$ is a global inhibition factor affecting lateral interactions between neurons.
	 
	\subsection{Attention selection phase}
	
	Let the activation of the $i^\mathrm{th}$ neuron represent the dynamics of an attention selection process at a particular location in the ego-space, such that 
	
	\begin{equation}
	\tau_\mathrm{a} \dot{\mathbf{a}}_{i(t)} = -\mathbf{a}_{i(t-1)} + q_\mathrm{a} + \sum_{j}^{} \mathbf{A}_{ij}f\left(\mathbf{a}_{(t-1)}, \mathbf{u}_{(t)}\right) 
	\label{eq:sel}
	\end{equation}
	
	\noindent Inhibitory neural interaction has been associated with selection mechanisms \cite{schoner2016}. Thus, we propose to model lateral interaction $\mathbf{A}_{ij}$ between neuron $i$ and $j$ such that

	\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{A}_{ij}(|\mathbf{x}_i-\mathbf{x}_j|) = 1 - \varphi\mathbf{U}_{ij}	
	\label{eq:sel-syn}
	\end{equation}
	
	\noindent with $\varphi = \mathrm{max}(\mathbf{U}_{i:})^{-1}$ a scaling factor. The activation function $f$ in Eq. \eqref{eq:sel} is defined so

	\begin{equation}
	f\left(\mathbf{a}_{(t-1)}, \mathbf{u}_{(t)}\right) = \mathrm{sigmoid} \left(\alpha \left(\mathbf{a}_{i(t-1)} + \gamma_\mathrm{u} \mathbf{u}_{i(t)}\right)\right)
	\label{eq:sel-fa}
	\end{equation}
	
	\noindent being $\gamma_\mathrm{u}$ and $\alpha$ gain constants.
	
	\subsection{Object focus output layer}
	
	Let the probability $\mathbf{k}_\mathrm{i(t)}$ of attending to the $i^\mathrm{th}$ object be modeled as the output layer, such that
	
	\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{k}_\mathrm{i(t)} = \mathrm{softmax}\left(\gamma_{\mathrm{k}}\sum_{j}^{} \mathbf{O}_{ij(t)}\mathbf{a}_{j(t)}\right)
	\label{eq:out}
	\end{equation}
	
	\noindent where $\mathbf{O}_{ij}(|\mathbf{\hat{p}}_i-\mathbf{x}_j|)$ is obtained from Eq. \eqref{eq:pre-sel-syn} with $\mathbf{\hat{p}}_i$ the projection of the object's center of mass in the ego-sphere, and $\gamma_{\mathrm{k}}$ represents a gain factor constant.
	
	%\tau\dot{u}_i(x,t) = -u_i(x,t) + h + s_i(x,t) + \sum\limits_{i=0}^{j=N-1} w(|x_i-x_j|)f\left(u\left(x_j,t\right)\right)


%	\noindent with the stimulation input $\mathbf{s}_{i(t)}$ defined such that
%	\begin{equation}
%	\mathbf{s}_{i(t)} = \sum_{o}^{} (\mathbf{W}_{ij}+\epsilon)\mathbf{u}_{i(t-1)} + \varsigma \mathbf{s}_{i(t)} 
%	\label{eq:pre-sel-input}
%	\end{equation}
	

%	Let a ego-sphere representation of sensory information be modeled by the following neural network architecture \cite{amari1977}.

	\section{METHODOLOGY}
	\label{sec:methodology}

	We designed several studies in simulation for testing AEGO and analyzing potential application scenarios. We also conducted a real experiment with the robot Pepper considering propioception, vision and basic natural language recognition. The details of the methodology are next.

	\subsection{Materials and Resources}
	
	The hardware components included a computer with 64 GB RAM memory, 11${}^\mathrm{th}$ Generation Intel\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Core\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} i9-11950H @ 2.60GHz Ã— 16, and graphic card NVIDIA RTX A4000 (although the program execution did not directly use GPU resources). The project counted on a humanoid robot Pepper, manufactured by Softbank Robotics. The software components were implemented in Python programming language versions 2.7 and 3, running in Ubuntu (20.04 LTS). The library MediaPipe version 0.10.3 was used for tracking the human skeleton from monocular vision. The library \textit{naoqi} version 2.5.7.1 was employed for implementing the control programs  for Pepper and the software Choregraphe version 2.8.6.23 was used for simulations. 
	
	\subsection{Simulations}
	
	Table \ref{tab:params} presents common parameters for the pre-selection, selection and output layers described in Eqs. \eqref{eq:pre-sel}, \eqref{eq:sel} and \eqref{eq:out}. The state of the network is obtained by numerical integration by the Euler method, according to the time-step $dt$. As shown in Fig \ref{fig:sim_objs}, six objects where simulated as bottom-up sources of stimulation to the agent. Three interactions situation relying of the recognition of basic words where considered to explore top-down modulation of attention. These situations are described below.

	\subsubsection{Focus on a specific object}
	
	we investigated the possibility of attending to a specific object as modulated by top-down processes. For this, it is assumed that the agent is able to track and recognize objects in the scene while associating unique words for addressing to them. A numerical ID could serve this purpose. Thus, once the human says "three", attention should be directed to location $\mathbf{\hat{p}}_3$ as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:sim_objs}. For this, the term $\mathbf{s}_{i(t,\Xi)}$ in Eq. \eqref{eq:pre-sel} can be set so
	
	\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{s}_{i(t,\Xi)} = \sum_{j}^{} \gamma_{\mathrm{o}j}\mathbf{O}_{ij(t)}\left(|\mathbf{\hat{p}}_{j(t)} - \mathbf{x}_{i(t)}|\right)
	\label{eq:sim1}
	\end{equation}
	
	Interest to the $j^{\mathrm{th}}$ object is modeled through the gain $\gamma_{\mathrm{o}j}$. For bottom-up saliency  $\gamma_\mathrm{bu} = 0.9$ for all detected objects, whereas for top-down modulation it is set to $\gamma_\mathrm{td} = 12\gamma_\mathrm{bu}$. As the object's name is recognized with probability $w$, when exceeding a given threshold it influences the model according to a unit step function $\lambda = f(t_\mathrm{w}, t_\mathrm{w}+\delta_\mathrm{t})$, thus
	
	 \begin{equation}
	 \gamma_{\mathrm{o}j} = \lambda\gamma_\mathrm{td}+ (1-\lambda)\gamma_\mathrm{bu}
	 \label{eq:sim1-step}
	 \end{equation}
	
	\noindent The duration $\delta_\mathrm{t} = 1\ \mathrm{sec}$. The local influence of stimuli in the neural field $\mathbf{O}_{ij(t)}$ is set conforming to Eq. \eqref{eq:pre-sel-syn}.
	
	\subsubsection{Searching around and object} this simulation considered interactions base on perspective-taking, where someone indicates a topological reference in agent's perspective such as turning attention to a stimulus at \textit{right}, \textit{left}, \textit{above} or \textit{below}, which are terms recognized by the robot. Thus, $\mathbf{s}_{i(t,\Xi)}$ in Eq. \eqref{eq:pre-sel} is modeled such that
	
	\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{s}_{i(t,\Xi)} = \sum_{j}^{} f\left(\gamma_\mathrm{r}m_{(t)}\right)\ g\left(\left|\boldsymbol{\hat{\mu}}_{(t)} - \mathbf{x}_{i(t)}\right|\right)
	\label{eq:sim2}
	\end{equation}
	\noindent where $f(.)$ is the sigmoid function with $\gamma_\mathrm{r}$ representing a gain constant and $g(.)$ is the multivariate Gaussian function (see Eq. \eqref{eq:pre-sel-syn}). The coordinates of the projection $\boldsymbol{\hat{\mu}}$ on the ego-sphere, representing attention selection, are obtained so 
	
	\begin{equation}
	\boldsymbol{\hat{\mu}}_{(t)} = \sum_{i}^{}\mathbf{k}_\mathrm{i(t-1)}\mathbf{\hat{p}}_{i(t)}
	\label{eq:sim2-mu}
	\end{equation}
	
	It is interest noticing that by considering feedback from the output layer $\mathbf{k}_\mathrm{i(t-1)}$ at previous time step (see Eq. \eqref{eq:out}), a local search could be achieved if the agent was actually focusing on a particular object. For the case of horizontal search, the $y$ coordinate of the points projection are considered, whereas for vertical search the $z$ coordinate would be of more relevance. Therefore, $m_{(t)}$ in Eq. \eqref{eq:sim2} is selected so
	
	\begin{equation}
	m_{(t)} = 
	\left\{
	\begin{split}
	\boldsymbol{\hat{\mu}}_{\mathrm{y}(t)}- \mathbf{\hat{p}}_{j\mathrm{y}(t)} & : \mathrm{``right"}\\
	\mathbf{\hat{p}}_{j\mathrm{y}(t)} - \boldsymbol{\hat{\mu}}_{\mathrm{y}(t)}& : \mathrm{``left"}\\
	\boldsymbol{\hat{\mu}}_{\mathrm{z}(t)}- \mathbf{\hat{p}}_{j\mathrm{z}(t)} & : \mathrm{``above"}\\
	\mathbf{\hat{p}}_{j\mathrm{z}(t)} - \boldsymbol{\hat{\mu}}_{\mathrm{z}(t)} & : \mathrm{``below"}\\
	\end{split}\right.
	\label{eq:sim2-m}
	\end{equation}
	
	\noindent Similarly to previous scenario, the gain $\gamma_{\mathrm{o}j}$ is set conforming to Eq. \eqref{eq:sim1-step} with duration $\delta_\mathrm{t} = 1\ \mathrm{sec}$. 
	
	\subsubsection{Focus on another object} the situation considered here is the agent's lost of interest to an object form receiving negative feedback from the human. For this, inhibitory feedback from the selection layer $\mathbf{a}_{(t-1)}$ is provided to the pre-selection later $\mathbf{u}_{(t)}$ (see Eqs. \eqref{eq:pre-sel},\eqref{eq:sel}). The term $\mathbf{s}_{i(t,\Xi)}$ in Eq. \eqref{eq:pre-sel} is modeled with a gain constant $\gamma_\mathrm{n}$, such that
	
	\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{s}_{i(t,\Xi)} = -\mathrm{softmax}\left(\gamma_\mathrm{n}\mathbf{a}_{i(t-1)}\right)
	\label{eq:sim3}
	\end{equation}
	
	\noindent The gain $\gamma_{\mathrm{o}j}$ is set conforming to Eq. \eqref{eq:sim1-step} but the duration of stimulation is selected shorter for this case $\delta_\mathrm{t} = 0.5\ \mathrm{sec}$.

	\subsection{Experiment}
	
	An interaction experiment was designed with the robot Pepper. Since the robot is capable of recognizing typical landmarks, some were attached to locations on the environment representing objects. The robot is also capable of speech recognition within dialog context, so it was programmed to recognize the terms \textit{above}, \textit{below}, \textit{left}, \textit{right}, \textit{no}, \textit{one}, \textit{two}, \textit{three}, and so on. The ego-space was placed at the robot's \textit{Torso} frame, when in Stand-up posture. In this study we do not consider the possibility of rotation and translation of the ego-sphere (which would require of geometrical remapping), so the experiment would correspond to situations of short interactions where participants talk about objects around. 
	
	\textcolor{orange}{[I got until here ...]}
	%The library MediaPipe was used to track the human skeleton and represent his/her ego-sphere, from the robot's on-board camera acquisitions. Thus, the robot was programmed to keep the human's full body in view during interaction. The human provided feedback to the robot verbally or by pointing to locations in the environment. In order to track non-verbal focus of attention, the intersection of both forearms with the ego-sphere (once reaching a certain height with respect to center frame located at the torso) was considered as a measure of interest to the surrounding. As for the robot, the human's ego-sphere is assumed to be fixed during interaction. To provide the robot with perspective-taking, a learning stage was designed so the human points to objects during 5 seconds while naming them. Hence, stimulation from human's non-verbal behavior is modeled with gain $\gamma_{\mathrm{h}}$, the human activation layer $\mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{h}(t)}$ and Hebbian synaptic weights $\mathbf{H}_{ij(t)}$, such that  
		
%	\begin{equation}
%		\mathbf{s}_{i(t,\Xi)} = \gamma_{\mathrm{h}}\sum_{j}^{} \mathbf{H}_{ij(t)}\mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{h}j(t)}
%		\label{eq:exp}
